### Adding Gallery Items

To add items to the gallery (bottom thumbnail strip) simply add an image
with a syntax like 

```
<div class="content">
	<div>		<a href="1.jpg"><img src="1_thumb.jpg" title=" Title" alt="Alt" class="thumb" /></a>	</div>
</div>
```

where `1.jpg` is the path of full size Image. 

And `1_thumb.jpg` is the path of the thumbnail, make sure the
thumbnails are of the dimensions **207** x **138** or the same height. 


### Changing Content Area Text

Doing this is fairly easy, just change the content within the paragraphs
and headings within the `<article>` element. 


### Fonts

The template uses the font **"Myriad Pro"** and  **"Century Gothic"**.
